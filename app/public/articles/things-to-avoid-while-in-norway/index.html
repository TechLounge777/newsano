    <h1>Don't leave the tip</h1>
    <p>Not much tipping is required in Norway, as the service charge will always be included in your bill.</p><br> 
        It is common courtesy, however, to round up your bill to the next even 5 or 10 NOK amount, e.g. a 37,58 bill to 40 NOK. 10% is considered generous, but leave more than 15% and youâ€™re just showing off.
